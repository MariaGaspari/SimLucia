This GitHub contains the core code and part of the data sets used in the paper:
Unveiling Vulnerabilities: Integrating Socioeconomic and Physical Dimensions in Residential Exposure Modelling, published in the International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction in 2025.

The core code includes the SimLucia model (SimLucia.R), a spatial microsimulation model for residential building exposure development incorporating key structural and economic dimensions of vulnerability in Saint Lucia. It takes as inputs a sample of dummy household-level data (MicrodataSample.csv) and the 2010 census data sets (Census_HHLD.csv).

Since the actual microdata sample from the 2016 Living Conditions and Household Budgets Survey used in this paper is confidential, we cannot make them available. To access the data, please contact the Central Statistical Office of Saint Lucia.

Required Operating System
This code was developed using R version 4.3.2. All necessary packages for this code to run are included in the "SimLucia.R" file.
